          Radio Scientists from South Asia and South East Asia region, the majority being from India, will get together for the URSI Regional Conference in Radio Science this year (URSI-RCRS 2024). This biennial gathering will take place from 1st to 4th of December 2022, in IIT Indore located in central India. URSI-RCRS 2024 promises to be an important event that will attract approximately 250 -300 delegates working on a diverse range of topics related to electromagnetic waves,   radio communications,  signal processing,  photonics, radio astronomy, ionosphere, remote sensing and electromagnetics in biology, etc. We expect a wide spectrum of participants from academia, industry, and government laboratories not just from India but also representing countries in SE Asia.
      <br>
          It is our endeavour to evolve a robust sponsorship and exhibitor program, which will offer the participants an excellent opportunity to meet and discuss common issues, introduce new developments and explore opportunities for collaboration. In the following, we outline how your organization can get involved, either as a sponsor or an exhibitor or both.<br>
          <br>
          URSI-RCRS 2024 will take place at the gleaming campus of IIT Indore, an island of architectural excellence with good guest houses and a clean natural environment 25 km from India’s `clean’ city of Indore. It is an excellent location for providing a conducive ambience for participants from Industry and Academia to discuss technology issues, learn from each other and further knowledge to create a self-reliant India. Indore, a prominent historic and cultural city offers great chances for participants from the Industry to relax in a great `foodie’ ambiance. Weather wise, early December is very pleasant, with the temperatures in the range of 20-25˚C. The chances of rainfall are close to zero.<br>
      <br>
          The local organizing committee and the URSI commission chairs are working hard to make both the technical program and the social events meet and exceed expectations for delegates, sponsors and exhibitors alike. We invite you to take part in supporting this Conference by selecting one or more of the many opportunities that are offered below. Doing so, will demonstrate your organization's position as a leader in this field and allow you to raise your profile with South Asia’s top radio science researchers. We hope to have your organization's name associated with this event.
