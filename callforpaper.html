        <p class="my-5 text-dark" style="text-align:justify">The URSI-RCRS 2024 Scientific Program Committee cordially invites you to submit papers for oral and poster presentations in the conference. Authors must electronically submit either an Extended Abstract (minimum 250 words, maximum one page) or a Summary Paper (minimum two pages, maximum four pages) by 9 July 2024 (Tuesday).<br>
            All the submitted papers will undergo a peer review process by experts on the subject and, if accepted, will be assigned to the appropriate session for presentations (oral/poster). One author registration will allow presentation of up to two papers in the conference. Summary Papers presented at this URSI-RCRS 2024 will be <b>submitted for posting to IEEE Xplore</b> unless authors would like to opt out themselves. In addition, there will be special programmes for URSI young scientists and a student paper competition for students.<b>The flyer of the conference can be found here</b><a href="#" >(Conference Flyer).</a>
