          <h2><b> Student Paper Competition (SPC) </b></h2><br><br>
Full-time university/institute students from any country, who is the principal (first-named) author and the presenter of a paper (oral or poster) at a regular session of URSI-RCRS 2024, are eligible for application in the SPC.<br><br>
<br>Applications should be completed electronically on the URSI-RCRS 2024 conference website by last date (link). For SPC submission the following documents (in PDF format) must be submitted simultaneously through the paper submission portal:<br>

• <b>Full-length paper (4 pages) IEEE paper style:</b> The instructions given on the conference website must be followed for preparing this. <br>
          • <b>Electronically scanned Letter of Certification from his/her advisor(s):</b><br>This should be printed on the university/institute letterhead and signed by the applicant’s advisor, clearly stating that the applicant is a full-time student for a degree at the time of application. For a paper with multiple authors, the letter should emphasize that the role of the authors other than the applicant was primarily advisory in nature.<br><br>

The URSI-RCRS 2024 Young Scientist and Student Program (YSSP) Committee will peer-review the SPC applications. Five finalists will be selected at the end of the review process. The YSSP Committee will email all the SPC applicants on <b style="color:red"> 7 ……..2024</b>, notifying them about the review results. On <b style="color:red"> 31 ……..2024</b>, the list of the SPC finalists will be announced on the URSI-RCRS 2024 website. Within two weeks of the notification, every finalist must confirm that he/she will attend URSI-RCRS 2024.<br><br>
The SPC Special Session, open to all URSI-RCRS 2024 participants, will be scheduled during the conference duration. All the five finalists should –<br>
